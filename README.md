## Webscraper to Update CRM Item Descriptions and Pricing

For a technology reseller business it can be a significant challenge to keep pricing information up to date and in line with customer expectations. Often manufacturers set a list price to guide the market on how the products should be priced or they may set rules through minmum advertized (MAP) prices which reseller partners agree to obey with financial conciquences for below MAP violation. Often it's hard to maintain compliance with these pricing structiures for a reseller who works with many products and manufacturers. The goal of this project is to start with a list of products exported from a CRM or web store and use Python to programatically scrape this manufacturers page in order to generate an updated llist of current prices for the products. The scope is to work with one manufacturer, Ergotron a firm focussed on providing ergonomic technology integration solutions, and create some basic tools to utilize part numbers from the CSV file for Ergotron products and come back with current pricing allowing for quick and easy generation of updated price files to be used with web listings and CRM product quoting software. The hope is to continue to build on some of the techniques used here to update information with other manufacturers and to further streamline the process of updating and maintaining compliance with manufacturer pricing programs.
